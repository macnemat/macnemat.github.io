                Hi! I’m Matthew MacNeil a programmer and designer from Ottawa, Canada. I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts Honours from Brock University in 2023 with a degree in Interactive Arts and
                Science. I am extremely passionate about video games and interactive storytelling. From inception to delivery, the process of bringing a project to life from design documents is
                what I strive for. The ability to convey emotions and feelings in people through stories is what I care for. Not just stories in terms of narrative but the stories that are created
                from gameplay, the challenges and the successes players go through to complete a game. All of this is why I program, why I’m here. If you want to get in touch with me about any job
                opportunities, then I’m more than happy to talk to you.
